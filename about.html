        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <br>
        <p>ERI is an institute committed to the cause of quality education for the society with special emphasis on moral values.The current scenario of education is quite unsatisfactory for anyone belonging to less than the elite class. Since the Government has adopted a “hands off” policy regarding education, the schools run by the Government have deplorably low attendance. This leaves the educational field totally in private hands, turning it into a profitable industry. The most resourceful segment of the society opts for those schools, whose fee structure is unimaginably high. The students studying in those schools are trained in a way to fit more comfortably in Western Society rather than having any ambition to serve their own country. On the other hand, even if one finds a school which is affordable by a common person, it does not provide any program of skills and cognition development for students. Further, the teachers lack of proper training required to groom the natural abilities of the children, and thus resort to the easiest method of making them memorize the bits and pieces of knowledge. Students may get very high grades in exams and hold high degrees but they mostly lack the knowledge required for practical fields. There is another aspect of present education system which requires serious attention from the educationists all over the world. Although there is a lot of emphasis on improving, the worldwide literacy rate but mere literacy does not make a society educated. The major problem with today’s
            education is the lack of proper moral values on which depends the stability of the whole society. The educationists are becoming more and more aware that unless this important aspect of education is brought back in the curriculum the next generation cannot be saved from self-destruction in one way or the other. Realizing the need of time ERI was established in 1995 by a group of like-minded educationists to come up with the solutions to some of the problems in the field of education.</p>
